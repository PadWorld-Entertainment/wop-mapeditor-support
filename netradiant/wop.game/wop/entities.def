_* ENTITIES

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED _skybox (.77 .88 1) (-16 -16 -16) (16 16 16)
SKYBOX ENTITY.
-------- KEYS --------
"angle" : rotation angle of the sky surfaces.
"angles" : Individual control of PITCH, YAW, and ROLL (default 0 0 0).
"_scale" : scaling factor (default 64), good values are between 50 and 300, depending on the map.
-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies a the origin of a skybox (a wholly contained, seperate area of the map), similar to some games' portal skies. When compiled with Q3Map2, the skybox surfaces will be visible from any place where sky is normally visible. It will cast shadows on the normal parts of the map, and can be used with cloud layers and other effects.
*/

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED _decal (0 1 0) ?
DECAL ENTITY.
-------- KEYS --------
"target" the name of the entity targeted at for projection
-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies a decal to be projected. Should contain 1 or more patch meshes (curves) and target an info_null entity. The distance between the center of the _decal entity and the target is the axis and distance of projection.

AMMO_* ENTITIES

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED ammo_imperius (.3 .3 1) (-16 -16 -16) (16 16 16) SUSPENDED RANDOMSELECT
IMPERiUS AMMO. Gives the player 2 by default.
-------- KEYS --------
wait : time in seconds before item respawns after being picked up (default 40, -1 = never respawn).
random : random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay (default 0 - see Notes).
count: sets the amount of ammo given to the player when picked up (default 2).
team : set this to team items. Teamed items will respawn rotational after team master is picked up (see Notes).
target : picking up the item will trigger the entity this points to.
targetname : a target_give entity can point to this for respawn freebies.
gametype: entity will spawn in selected gametypes ("ffa", "tournament", "single", "spray", "lps", "team", "ctl", "sptp", "balloon") only.
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTL" modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
notbot : used to make an item invisible for bot attraction. 
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
SUSPENDED : item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't drop to the floor.
RANDOMSELECT : teamed items will spawn in random cycle instead of rotational cycle.
-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the rotational respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up. Use RANDOMSELECT spawnflag to change respawning cycle from rotational to random.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

noise : path/name of .wav file to play. Use looping sounds only (eg. sound/world/drone6.wav).
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/jets/jets01.md3).
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of entity's rotation axis and .md3 model included with entity (default "0 0 0" - See Notes).
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
gametype: entity will spawn in selected gametypes ("ffa", "tournament", "single", "spray", "lps", "team", "ctl", "sptp", "balloon") only.
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.

notlps : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "LPS" mode.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- NOTES --------
You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity. The center of that brush will be the point through which the rotation axis passes. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. Pendulum will rotate along the X axis by default. Very crude operation: pendulum cannot rotate along Z axis, the speed of swing (frequency) is not adjustable. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.*/

/*QUAKED func_plat (0 .5 .8) ?
Rising platform the player can ride to reach higher places. Plats must always be drawn in the raised position, so they will operate and be lighted correctly but they spawn in the lowered position. The plat will stay in the raised position until the player steps off. There are no proper sounds for this entity, only beep noises. It will spawn in the game and work properly but it sounds silly (see Notes).
-------- KEYS --------
speed : determines how fast the plat moves (default 150).
lip : lip remaining at end of move (default 16). Has no effect if "height" is set.
height : if set, this will determine the total amount of vertical travel of the plat.
dmg : damage to inflict on player when he blocks operation of plat (default 4). Plat will reverse direction when blocked.
targetname : if set, the trigger that points to this will raise the plat each time it fires. The plat raises and comes back down a second later if no player is on it.
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/pipe/pipe02.md3).
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of .md3 model included with entity (See Notes).
gametype: entity will spawn in selected gametypes ("ffa", "tournament", "single", "spray", "lps", "team", "ctl", "sptp", "balloon") only.
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTL" modes.
notlps : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "LPS" mode.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- NOTES --------
By default, the total amount of vertical travel of a platform is implicitly determined by the overall vertical size of the brushes of which it's made minus the lip value. But if the "height" key is used, then the total amount of vertical travel of the plat will be exactly that value regardless of the shape and size of the plat and regardless of the value of the "lip" key. Using the "height" key is the best method for any kind of platforms and the only possible one for thin plats which need to travel vertical distances many times their own thickness. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

There is a way to make plats play proper sounds. Just create a sound\movers\plats folder under baseq3 and put 2 sounds named pt1_strt.wav and pt1_end.wav in it. Those can be the renamed sounds from the Q2 plats or renamed copies of the sound\movers\doors sounds you can extract from your pak0.pk3 file or new custom sounds if you're up to it. Thanks to Fragzilla for the tip.*/

     in tp-spraymode: red spraywall scores for the red team and the blue sw for the blue team (neutral sw will be deactive)
     in ffa-spraymode: you can score at every spraywall
-------- NOTES --------
When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value. If a model is included with a targeted func_static, the brush(es) of the entity will be removed from the game but the .md3 model won't: it will automatically be moved to the (0 0 0) world origin so you should NOT include an .md3 model to a targeted func_static.

Because the map has only a single bot navigation file, func_static's cannot be used to make significant changes in game play flow between differing game types.*/

-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the rotational respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up. Use RANDOMSELECT spawnflag to change respawning cycle from rotational to random.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

The item_botroam entity can be used when a bot does not roam the whole level or prefers to go to only specific areas. This (invisible) item can be placed in a map just like regular items. Nobody can actually pick up the item it's only used to attract bots to certain places of the map. The value is the weight of the roam_item is relative to the weight assigned other items in the map (each bot has its own weights). The bot character specific item weights are stored with the bot characters AI files ("botname"_i.c for items and "botname"_w.c for weapons) in the botfiles/bots/ sub-folder in the .pk3 file.*/

Sound generating entity that plays .wav files. Normal non-looping sounds play each time the target_speaker is triggered. Looping sounds can be set to play by themselves (no activating trigger) or be toggled on/off by a trigger.
-------- KEYS --------
noise : path/name of .wav file to play (eg. sound/world/growl1.wav - see Notes).
wait : delay in seconds between each time the sound is played ("random" key must be set - see Notes).
random : random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay ("wait" key must be set - see Notes).

notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
LOOPED_ON : sound will loop and initially start on in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
LOOPED_OFF : sound will loop and initially start off in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
GLOBAL : sound will play full volume throughout the level.
ACTIVATOR : sound will play only for the player that activated the target.
-------- NOTES --------
The path portion value of the "noise" key can be replaced by the implicit folder character "*" for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For example, if you want to create a "bottomless pit" in which the player screams and dies when he falls into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the "noise" key to "*falling1.wav". The * character means the current player model's sound folder. So if your current player model is Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create "player-specific" triggered sounds in your levels.

The combination of the "wait" and "random" keys can be used to play non-looping sounds without requiring an activating trigger but both keys must be used together. The value of the "random" key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).*/

team : set this to team items. Teamed items will respawn rotational after team master is picked up (see Notes).
target : picking up the item will trigger the entity this points to.
targetname : a target_give entity can point to this for respawn freebies.
gametype: entity will spawn in selected gametypes ("ffa", "tournament", "single", "spray", "lps", "team", "ctl", "sptp", "balloon") only.

notbot : used to make an item invisible for bot attraction.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
SUSPENDED : item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't drop to the floor.
RANDOMSELECT : teamed items will spawn in random cycle instead of rotational cycle.
-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the rotational respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up. Use RANDOMSELECT spawnflag to change respawning cycle from rotational to random.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

/*QUAKED worldspawn (0 0 0) ?
Only used for the world.
-------- KEYS --------
message : text to print at user logon. Used for name of level.
music : path/name of looping .wav file used for level's music (eg. music/sonic5.wav).
ambient : Adds a constant value to overall lighting. Use is not recommended. Ambient light will have a tendency to flatten out variations in light and shade.
_color : RGB value for ambient light color (default is 0 0 0).
gravity : gravity of level (default is normal gravity: 800).
gridsize : granularity of the lightgrid created by q3map. Value is three integers separated by spaces, representing number of units between grid points in X Y Z. Default gridsize value is 128 128 256. Use larger powers of 2 to reduce BSP size and compile time on very large maps.
_blocksize : q3map always splits the BSP tree along the planes X=_blocksize*n and Y=_blocksize*n. Default _blocksize value is 1024. Increase the blocksize using larger powers of 2 to reduce compile times on very large maps with a low structural brush density.
maxsprayroomtime : timelimit for the sprayroom (sprayffa/spraytd)
skylensflare_dir: direction of the sky-lensflare ... (eg. "10 10 10" or "0.507 0.374 0.777" ... "/set cg_printDir 1" can be helpful)
skylensflare: name of the lensflare
