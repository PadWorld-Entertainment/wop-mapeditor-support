/*QUAKED _decal (0 1.0 0) ?
Compiler-only entity. Specifies a decal for projection.
-------- KEYS --------
"target" : The entity which is targetted at for projection.
-------- NOTES --------
A decal is created by grouping one or more bezier patches and targetting it into an info_null entity. Axis and distance of projection are determined by the distance between the center of the _decal entity and the target. 
*/

/*QUAKED _skybox (0.77 0.88 1.0) (-16 -16 -16) (16 16 16)
Compiler-only entity. Specifies the origin of a skybox in a contained area of the map, far from the actual level.
-------- KEYS --------
"angle" : Determines a facing angle (see note 1). Default: 0.
"angles" : Individual control of PITCH, YAW, and ROLL (see note 1). Default: 0 0 0.
"_scale" : Scaling factor, good values are between 50 and 300, depending on the map. Default: 64.
-------- NOTES --------
1. The keys 'angle' and 'angles' are mutually exclusive. Only one of them can be used at a time.
2. A skybox casts shadows on normal parts of the map and allows the use of cloud layers and other effects. After compiling, the skybox will replace any sky shaders present in the map, except, of course, those in the skybox itself.

/*QUAKED ammo_balloony (0.3 0.3 1.0) (-16 -16 -16) (16 16 16) SUSPENDED RANDOM
Ammunition bottle for BALLOONY.
-------- KEYS --------
"count" : Amount of ammo given to the player on pickup (see note 1). Default: 10.
"gametype" : If set, the entity will ONLY appear in these gametypes (see note 2).
"notgametype" : If set, the entity will NOT appear in these gametypes (see note 2).
"notbot" : If set to 1, a bot will never attempt to pick up this item.
"notfree" : If set to 1, this entity won't spawn in free-for-all gametypes.
"notlps" : If set to 1, this entity won't spawn in lps gametype.
"notsingle" : If set to 1, this entity won't spawn in single-player mode.
"notteam" : If set to 1, this entity won't spawn in team-based gametypes.
"random" : Variation of time between respawns (see note 3). Default: 0.
"targetShaderName" : Shader to be swapped out for triggerable shader entities (see note 4).
"targetShaderNewName" : Shader to be swapped in for triggerable shader entities (see note 4).
"target" : Picking up the item will trigger these targets.
"targetname" : A target_give entity can point at this item so its given to the player.
"team" : If set, the entity is teamed up with items in this team (see note 1).
"wait" : Seconds before the item respawns again (see note 1). Default: 40, never respawns again: -1.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
"SUSPENDED" : The item will spawn at the coordinates where it was placed without falling on the floor.
"RANDOM" : Teamed items will spawn in random cycle instead of alternating cycle.
-------- NOTES --------
1. Unless you're designing a map with a specific kind of gameplay in mind, it's advisable to NOT set the 'wait' or 'count' keys. Doing so will mess with what players know about item timings and effects. The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's 'wait' key set to -1 (never respawn), the rotational respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up. Use 'RANDOM' spawnflag to change respawning cycle from rotational to random.
2. Values for the 'gametype' or 'notgametype' keys need to be separated by spaces. The valid values are the following: "ffa" "tournament" "single" "spray" "lps" "ctkd" "team" "freeze" "ctl" "onelolly" "balloon".
3. The value of the 'random' key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum time delay of an item respawn. The final delay is a random value that lies somewhere between the minimum and maximum values.
4. Upon activation of the targets, all shaders/textures in the map with the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderName will change to the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderNewName. This is useful for on/off switches, for example.

It can either be a square brush of 16x16x16 or 32x32x32 with the common/origin texture in all of its faces as part of the entity, or a pair of coordinates set in the 'origin' key. This origin is also tied to the 'noise' key, as otherwise the sound won't follow the entity as it moves.
4. The route of the '_celshader' and 'shader'/'_shader' keys MUST omit 'textures/' at the beginning, otherwise it won't work.
5. This entity can have a model attached to it. For this, the entity must have a 'targetname' key set, and the model must target this entity.

"target" : Attaches the misc_model to a func_entity with this targetname value.
-------- Q3MAP2 KEYS --------
"_castshadows" or "_cs" : Per-entity control over shadow casting. The values it can take are:
	* Under -1: Cast shadows on entities with _rs or _receiveshadows but NOT in the world.
	* -1: Doesn't cast shadows on the world.
	* 0: Casts shadows on entities. (Default)
	* 1: Casts shadows on the world. (Also default)
	* Over 1: Casts shadows on entities with _rs or _receiveshadows AND in the world.
"_celshader" : Cel shader used for this geometry (see note 3).
"_lightmapscale" : Scales the resolution of lightmaps on brushes and patches in the entity. Default: 1.0.
"_receiveshadows" or "_rs" : Per-entity control over shadow reception. The values it can take are:
	* 0: Doesn't receive shadows.
	* Range (0,1): Receive shadows from both entities with _cs or _castshadows and world.
	* 1: Receive shadows on everything (world shadows). This is the default value.

"_remap" : Remapping of shaders/textures on the model (see note 4).
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
"CLIP_MODEL" : Adds q3map_clipmodel to all shaders used by the model, which enables autoclipping for the model. It is recommended only for large models with relatively few triangles in their mesh (e.g. terrain).
"FORCE_META" : Adds q3map_forcemeta to all shaders used by the model, which converts model triangles to bsp metasurfaces. This allows the model to be lightmapped.
--------- NOTES --------
1. The keys 'angle' and 'angles' are mutually exclusive. Only one of them can be used at a time.
2. The keys 'modelscale' and 'modelscale_vec' are mutually exclusive. Only one of them can be used at a time.
3. The route of the '_celshader' and 'shader'/'_shader' keys MUST omit 'textures/' at the beginning, otherwise it won't work.
4. In order to remap a model, use '*;texturepath' in order to remap the whole model under a single texture/shader, or 'texturepath1;texturepath2' in order to remap a specific texture/shader. Any key that starts with the _remap prefix will work. So if you need more remappings, create '_remap2', '_remap3', and so on keys.

"team" : If set, the entity is teamed up with items in this team (see note 1).
"wait" : Seconds before the item respawns again (see note 1). Default: 5, never respawns again: -1.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
"SUSPENDED" : The item will spawn at the coordinates where it was placed without falling on the floor.
"RANDOM" : Teamed items will spawn in random cycle instead of alternating cycle.
-------- NOTES --------
1. Unless you're designing a map with a specific kind of gameplay in mind, it's advisable to NOT set the 'wait' or 'count' keys. Doing so will mess with what players know about item timings and effects. The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's 'wait' key set to -1 (never respawn), the rotational respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up. Use 'RANDOM' spawnflag to change respawning cycle from rotational to random.
2. Values for the 'gametype' or 'notgametype' keys need to be separated by spaces. The valid values are the following: "ffa" "tournament" "single" "spray" "lps" "ctkd" "team" "freeze" "ctl" "onelolly" "balloon".
3. Valid values for the 'marker' key are: orange, green, blue, black, and purple. Only one color can be defined at a time.
4. The value of the 'random' key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum time delay of an item respawn. The final delay is a random value that lies somewhere between the minimum and maximum values.
5. Upon activation of the targets, all shaders/textures in the map with the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderName will change to the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderNewName. This is useful for on/off switches, for example.

"notgametype" : If set, the entity will NOT appear in these gametypes (see note 2).
"notbot" : If set to 1, a bot will never attempt to pick up this item.
"notfree" : If set to 1, this entity won't spawn in free-for-all gametypes.

"team" : If set, the entity is teamed up with items in this team (see note 1).
"wait" : Seconds before the item respawns again (see note 1). Default: 5, never respawns again: -1.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
"SUSPENDED" : The item will spawn at the coordinates where it was placed without falling on the floor.
"RANDOM" : Teamed items will spawn in random cycle instead of alternating cycle.
-------- NOTES --------
1. Unless you're designing a map with a specific kind of gameplay in mind, it's advisable to NOT set the 'wait' or 'count' keys. Doing so will mess with what players know about item timings and effects. The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's 'wait' key set to -1 (never respawn), the rotational respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up. Use 'RANDOM' spawnflag to change respawning cycle from rotational to random.
2. Values for the 'gametype' or 'notgametype' keys need to be separated by spaces. The valid values are the following: "ffa" "tournament" "single" "spray" "lps" "ctkd" "team" "freeze" "ctl" "onelolly" "balloon".
3. Valid values for the 'marker' key are: orange, green, blue, black, and purple. Only one color can be defined at a time.
4. The value of the 'random' key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum time delay of an item respawn. The final delay is a random value that lies somewhere between the minimum and maximum values.
5. Upon activation of the targets, all shaders/textures in the map with the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderName will change to the shader/texture mentioned in targetShaderNewName. This is useful for on/off switches, for example.

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED worldspawn (0 0 0) ?
The main entity of the map. Every map should have exactly one worldspawn.
-------- KEYS --------
"enableBreath" : Enables a cough-like effect for the characters. Mostly used for ice cold environments.
"gravity" : Gravity of the level. Overrides the default value, is overriden by the game's set gravity value. Default: 800.
"maxsprayroomtime" : Time limit in seconds to stay in the spray room. Default 30. A player will be teleported to the kill room when hit.
"message" : Text displayed when a user enters the map. In WoP it should be: 'map name by mapper name'.
"music" : Path to the looping music file used for the level's soundtrack. Don't use it in WoP because of the jukebox player.
"skylensflare": Path to the sky lens flare script used in the map, usually 'Photoshop/50-300mmZoom' 
"skylensflare_dir": Origin of the sky lens flare (e.g. '0.507 0.374 0.777'). The command '/set cg_printDir 1' can be helpful.
-------- Q3MAP2 KEYS --------
"_ambient;ambient" : Constant value added to the overall lighting. Use not recommended, since ambient light has a tendency to flatten out variations in light and shade.
"_blocksize" : Size of the blocks q3map2 vis uses in order to calculate what's drawn in the screen. Higher values than the default are recommended for very large maps with low structural brush count. The calculation is based on the formulas X=_blocksize*n; Y=_blocksize*n. Default: 1024.
"_castshadows;_cs" : Per-entity control over shadow casting. The values it can take are:
	* Under -1: Cast shadows on entities with _rs or _receiveshadows but NOT in the world.
	* -1: Doesn't cast shadows on the world.
	* 0: Casts shadows on entities. (Default)
	* 1: Casts shadows on the world. (Also default)
	* Over 1: Casts shadows on entities with _rs or _receiveshadows AND in the world.
"_celshader" : Cel shader used for this geometry.
"_color" : Color of the ambient light. Default: 0 0 0.
"_farplanedist" : Amount of units the vis phase can see during compilation. In combination with level-wide fog, it can help reduce tris count on large, open maps.
"_foghull" : If set, the level will use the fog properties of this shader in order to render a level-wide fog.
"_keeplights" : Keeps lights in the BSP, preventing q3map2 from stripping them in the light phase.
"_lightmapscale" : Scales the resolution of lightmaps on brushes and patches in the world. Func_ entities can override this value. Default: 1.0.
"_mingridlight" : Minimum value of dynamic entity lighting, level-wide.
"_minlight" : Minimum value of world-wide lighting, level-wide, which uses ''_color'' to add a color to the ambience. Unlike _ambient and ambient, it does not add values to the other light entities.
"_minvertexlight" : Minimum value of vertex lighting, level-wide.
"_noshadersun" : Ignores the sky properties of the sky shaders, and ONLY uses entity sun lights.
"_receiveshadows;_rs" : Per-entity control over shadow reception. The values it can take are:
	* 0: Doesn't receive shadows.
	* Range (0,1): Receive shadows from both entities with _cs or _castshadows and world.
	* 1: Receive shadows on everything (world shadows). This is the default value.
	* Over 1: Receive shadows ONLY from entities with _cs or _castshadows.
"_styleNalphaGen" : AlphaGen value for the light style index of N. Values takes standard shader waveform functions (e.g. N=1 --> wave sin 0.5 0.3 0.25 1.5).
"_styleNrgbGen" : rgbGen value for the light style index of N. Values takes standard shader waveform functions (e.g. N=1 --> wave sin 0.5 0.3 0.25 1.5).
"gridsize" : Size of the lightgrid created by q3map2. The values represent the units in the X Y Z points. Large powers of 2 help reduce the BSP size and compile time on very large maps. Default: 128 128 256.
-------- Q3MAP2 TERRAIN KEYS --------
"_indexmap;alphamap" : Path of the art file used to guide the mapping of textures on the terrain surface.
"_layers;layers" : Number of unique root shaders that will be used on the terrain surface.
"_shader;shader" : Metashader used to assign textures to the terrain entity.
